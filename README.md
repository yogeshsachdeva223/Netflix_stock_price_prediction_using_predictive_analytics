<p>By Ayushi Arora, Yogesh Sachdeva and Arpit Govila</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this project we have tried to explore and visualize the NetFlix Stocks Price and we have created a stacked LSTM model for predicting the price of NetFlix Stocks</p>

# About Dataset

* The Drug Review Dataset is taken from Kaggle. This Dataset consists stock price of NetFlix from 2002 to 2021.


### Attributes :
1. **Date :** Date

3. **High :** The high is the highest price at which a stock is traded during a period.
4. **Low :** The low is the lowest price at which a stock is traded during a period.
5. **Close :** the price at which the stocks closes in the market
6. **Adjusted Close :** Stock Price after accounting 
7. **Volume :** number of shares traded in the stock

# Objective :

#### The Objective of this Project is to Analyse the Dataset, plot the inferences with good visualizations and create a model to predict future price of NetFlix Stocks.
